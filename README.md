# Aloha Apparel Co. Homepage

The goal of this project was to create a storefront homepage for the clothing company Aloha Apparel Co.

This project was my first built website, and focused on implementing many various styling choices and CSS properties. Layouts were based on Flexbox-styles, and the page is fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop. There is also some basic Javascript and JQuery implemented.

# Project Learnings/Takeaways
This project functioned as an excellent learning tool in setting up and applying styles to a modern and responsive site. It cemented basic best practices such as avoiding divitis, and creating a mobile-first page and then adding @media settings to support tablet/desktop. I learned how to best organize files for small projects, and how to initialize a project on GitHub.
