The goal of this project was to create a near-replica of a sample webpage for "Aloha Clothing": https://redacademy.github.io/aloha-apparel/#

The project implemented many various CSS properties, and focused on Flexbox-style layouts. There is also some
basic Javascript and JQuery implemented. 

This website functioned as an excellent learning tool in setting up and applying styles
to a modern and responsive site. It is designed and built to be mobile-first, with @media settings
for both desktop and tablet devices.
